## two-part part one
coming back for the stench that burned nothing like how home smells. i feel their looking, peering, concerned gazes, their anxieties nothing like anxieties about them. theirs unjust. they all are white notwithstanding that some of them are latino, black, and asian and they all are straight. they all are wealthy notwithstanding that some of them are poor and they all are christians. i turn around to face imaginary screamers, come to question my imaginary decision to paint black. unintentionally i stood before them without clothing, that they could slot already my social stratum; it appeared this was the way they justified themselves in their altercation. it is sickening.
i have been down; i have longed; i have idealized. they yet sicken me as i fire upon them in this moment of taking myself from their hands. my muscles are weak as i wrench ideals from their filth-ridden hands. for fear of dirt i give up. my stomach is unsettled, causing my whole body to shiver. i am fevered, nearly beyond myself.
"where to? where to?" i was roused. "i do not know," i reply to them. they are the ones to have given me this way. i am castigated. i grow old quickly, before i become something, something i do not know. i ache, before myself.
