## Writings from sophomore year
### Written in Algebra II
Suffering in place of heart and fulfillment in place of conscious for all ends in death, to death, to dust or fear and withering
Construct predetermined by chains and in chains
We are of chains, binding, lacking
### Fear
Fear... Why do I feel so afraid? Why am I now this way?
### God
We think of a higher power because there are problems we can't handle. So many we forget the majority of them. God could fix it. With enough praying or fasting maybe. Like these problems, we forget that we have religion. It hurts some of us.
### Lacking
Lacking everywhere in some way
No organization, routine
### Self-harm
Today I cut my skin. I felt like bleeding and I was normal.
### Do I love
Never was I yet ready for love
Never so ready, yet never to be prepared
An admirer, a lover, you too
Do I love
Have I a right mind?
Locked from the outside
She sleeps and I am fatigued
### Disorder
Hearing them enter the door as a sharp blade was forward, "Disorder, disorder!" I shouted. Yet a child was I, to think they might know it. And a child in their eyes, too. On the path to ripeness was I, they'd say. And so I spoke to a puppet. Wet red eyes. Then I'd take in my hands the intents for my skin. And wet red blood, to dry.
### Self-hate
I don't hate myself. I never will.
