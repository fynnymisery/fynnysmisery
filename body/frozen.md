"Why is that? I thought you were... Jack..." Aster began to tear up...

As the white-haired boy's head was pressed sideways into Aster's chest, Jack was paralyzed.
"I knew there was something wrong..." Bunny said, crying viciously. There was an echoing moment of Aster's heart beating in Jack's ear. Jack slowly lifted his arms around Aster.
"Don't let me go." Aster said brusquely. And as it was so difficult to know such an arousal of his heart, Jack found himself unwilling to ever release Aster.
