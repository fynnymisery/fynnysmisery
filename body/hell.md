## Hell
Startled, I tried to breathe. But the most gruesome terror took away only everything, and my breath did not mean anything. Throwing myself off the bed and onto the floor I realized I was inside my body. My sweet, aching, bleeding, faltering body still entrapped my soul so sweetly. I breathed in. And once my insides were suddenly warm, I breathed out my life. So I shook in the cold of the heated quarrel that was my mind trying to escape my brain and my skull. It burned so strongly into the center of my chest still that I tried to cling to the floor. Lest I jump away. But I couldn't quell it and sat up, looking towards the drawer, the earthen container. Pulled it open. Pulled out my rations. Pulled back my sleeve to show my palest, fearful skin and drew against it. Blood bestowed upon me a certain rosiness that contrasted with white. Not even so fair was my skin. Yet fears mean to change you.
